Dear [Team Lead's Name],

I hope you're doing well.

After much consideration, I have decided to move on from my current position at Toshiba in alignment with my long-term career goals.

It has been a truly rewarding experience to be part of Toshiba for the past 4 years. I am extremely grateful to have worked alongside such a supportive and talented team. The learning, growth, and memories I’ve gathered here will always remain special to me.

I would appreciate it if you could spare some time from your schedule to arrange a meeting at your convenience. I’d like to formally discuss my decision, the next steps in the resignation process, and ensure a smooth transition of responsibilities.

Please let me know a suitable time that works for you.

Warm regards,
